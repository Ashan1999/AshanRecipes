                <h2>Sri Lankan Fish Ambul Thiyal </h2>
                <p>
            
                    Ambul Thiyal is one of the most signature dishes in Sri Lankan cuisine. When I was first learning how to make it, I was thinking of ceviche a bit because the primary method for cooking the fish is by acid.
                    The fish, usually tuna, is cooked with white coconut vinegar (or lime juice) and garcinia paste. This paste, endemic to Sri Lanka, is made from the Garcinia Gummi-Gutta fruit; an acidic fruit that is also in the same family as mangosteen.
