        <p class="pra" >A fish recipe without oil? No onions, tomatoes, coconut, or coriander powder either? Well, that is Ambul thiyal for you. Very minimal ingredients and traditionally prepared in mud pots, yet so flavourful and to die for.
            Fish is mixed up in a paste mainly containing goraka (also called Cambodge or kudampuli in South India) and then cooked up on low flame till all the water evaporates and the fish actually burns a bit at the bottom.
            It goes so well with rice. As it cooks the flavours that emanate will make you salivate.
            The best part of it is that it can be kept at room temperature for weeks without getting spoilt. It seems that fish was preserved in this way, in those days when there was no refrigerator.
            This is a southern Srilankan recipe, having originated at Ambalangoda, a coastal town.
            The original recipe from here just uses black pepper powder and salt ground with goraka, in which the fish is cooked. But lots of modifications have been made by people from the rest of Srilanka, though most Southerners prefer to cook their traditional way.
            Authentically the mud pot is lined with banana leaves and a few curry leaves are strewn over it. The fish which is coated all over with the ground paste is lined at the base in a way that every piece touches the bottom of the pan.
            The remaining paste is poured over the fish, and water is also added to immerse the fish pieces.
            They are then cooked to boiling point and then simmered till all the moisture evaporates. Usually, tuna is used in this recipe, but you can use any firm fleshy fish and generally, fish fillets are used without the bone.
            This is my version, after going through a lot of recipes available online. You can follow it as is, or add the other ingredients as given in my P.S. Whichever you prefer, for fish lovers, this is a must-try.
            Especially for the people of Andhra and Telengana, who are insanely in love with Gongura. As with Gongura, the sour taste of the goraka has to be balanced by the heat from the pepper and salt. When the balance is perfect the dish is divine.

          <h1 class="h2m"><u>Ingredients</u></h1>
          <list class="list7"><ul>
          <li>Tuna - 500g (any firm fleshed fish such as Yellowfin tuna (Kelawalla), Sail fish (Thalapath) can be used but I have found that the Skipjack tuna (Balaya) works best )</li> 
          <li>	Onion - 50 g, sliced </li>
          <li>Fenugreek seeds - ½ tsp </li>
          <li>Pepper - 1 tsp, whole </li>
          <li>	Pandan leaf - 1 piece </li>
          <li>Salt - As needed </li>
          <li>Water - ½ Cup </li>
          <li>Banana leaf - 1 piece</li> 
          <li>For the paste</li>
          <li>Cardamom - 6 pods </li>
          <li>Cinnamon - 6 tsps, powdered </li>
          <li>Cumin powder - 1 tsp </li>
          <li>Coriander powder - 1 tsp</li> 
          <li>Pepper - 1 tsp </li>
          <li>Chili powder - 1 tsp</li> 
          <li>Roasted curry powder - 1 tsp </li>
          <li>Garlic - 3 cloves, crushed </li>
          <li>Green chili - 1, chopped </li>
          <li>Chili flakes - 1 tsp </li>
          <li>Goraka - 5 pieces </li>
          <li>	Salt - To taste </li>

        </ul></list>



          <h2 clss="h2n"><u>Instructions</u></h2>
          <list class="list8"><ol>
          <li>Boil a little water and add 2 pieces of goraka. Boil for about 10 minutes. Let it cool. Keep the water aside.</li>
          <li>Grind the softened goraka pieces and all the ingredients in the “paste” section together. (My mother used to hand-grind everything on the heavy grinding stone in the kitchen. But now she just uses the grinder. I do sense a difference in taste though between the two methods) Set aside.</li>
          <li>Wash the fish with clean water and a little lime. Combine it with the paste you made and set aside.</li>
          <li>Line a large clay pot in the piece of banana leaf. Place the paste covered fish, onions, fenugreek and the pandan leaf.</li>
          <li>Add the water that you boiled the goraka in. Cook on high covered on a wood fired stove until the mixture has started bubbling.</li>
          <li>Fill another clay pot with live burning coals. Remove the cover of the clay pot containing the fish and keep the clay pot filled with the burning coals on top of the other pot like its lid. The purpose is to create a grill like atmosphere with heat hitting the fish from above as well.</li>
          <li>Cook like this on low heat until the paste thickens to just enough coat the pieces of fish. Serve with rice, bread or even, with crackers!</li>
